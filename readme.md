# Minimal solvers for multi-camera and IMU calibration
Given a moveable rig consisting of three cameras with corresponding IMUs, use IMU data to find the position and orientation of the cameras. We assume that there is a known rigid transform from a camera to its IMU. This will be based on previous work by Isaac Skog, H?kan Carlsson et al. ([paper 1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7462272), [paper 2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8115879)) were the calibration was performed using a coordinate descent method in combination with classical non-linear least squares methods. These methods may not always converge or may converge slowly. In this project we will investigate whether the solution could be made more robust and/or faster by utilizing the action matrix method (see e.g. Chapter 7 in Viktor Larssons thesis [Computational Methods for Computer Vision: Minimal Solvers and Convex Relaxations](https://portal.research.lu.se/portal/en/publications/computational-methods-for-computer-vision%28cc1ae2a2-409d-414c-87e0-ec381d22649d%29.html)). With this method the problem can be transformed into an eigen decomposition problem for which there are fast numerically stable solvers. Additionally, this method is a global optimization method that does not need to be initialized.
